# TensorFlow Bijectors
- In this project, I explored how to use TensorFlow Probability Bijectors to transform distributions and perform operations on them.
- You can get the code in [tensorflow_bijectors.ipynb](./tensorflow_bijectors.ipynb)

## Bijector Basics
- Used TensorFlow Probability's `Bijector` class to transform standard distributions.
- Applied transformations such as `Exp` and `Affine` to base distributions to create new transformed distributions.


## Chain of Bijectors
- Demonstrated how to apply a chain of bijectors to perform multiple transformations on distributions.


## Setup
- Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate virtual environment: `call venv/Scripts/activate.bat` in cmd
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Libraries
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Probability
- Matplotlib
